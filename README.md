# RFID Object Tracking System

This project is a tracking system designed to monitor the movement and efficiency of RFID-tagged objects as they progress through multiple predefined zones. Each zone has a shared entry and exit point, ensuring streamlined tracking as the object advances through the production stages. The system records key data at each checkpoint, including production time, efficiency rates, and other critical metrics.

Access to the collected data is restricted to administrators and authorized personnel, who can view detailed reports and assess the overall performance of the production process.

## Key Features:

- Real-time tracking of RFID-tagged objects across multiple zones.
- Shared entry/exit points between consecutive zones for streamlined tracking.
- Admin access to critical data, including production time and efficiency metrics.
- Secure access control for data viewing by authorized users only.
